## Pathfinder-2E-Random-Character-Generator

## Project Description 

It can be very difficult to get into a new Table-Top RPG, and Pathfinder especially has a reputation for having a complex character creation process. 

The goal of this project is to create a user friendly tool that generates a new and optimized character that is ready to play immediately. The user can either select one of the 12 class options, or select random, and a new character will be generated with the following fields all configured:
    -Ancestry
    -Class & Class Features
    -Ability Scores
    -Skill Proficiencies
